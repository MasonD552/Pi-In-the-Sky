## Planning

### Problem 
Designing and constructing the AeroData Tracker, an advanced glider made of styrofoam, equipped with sensors and a motor to maintain speed, presents a multifaceted challenge. The goal extends beyond achieving a successful flight and data capture; it also is demonstrating precise control over the glider's smooth flight.

### Sketches, Drawings, Diagrams, etc.

### Iterations/Solutions
1. Attach a small, lightweight motor to help keep the glider in the air longer
2. Make the glider remote-controlled, adding fins and a more powerful motor.
3. Use a combination of sensors and a recording device for comprehensive data capture.

## Risk_Mitigation
When talking about risk we first have to talk about potential dangers. The propeller is the main safety hazard because it spins so fast, to protect ourselves we are going to wear gloves as well as safety glasses. The other problem is the plane coming back and hitting someone in the head (it happened to mason) to protect us from this we will also wear safety glasses because the main risk is the propeller and we might also wear a hat or helmet. 

## Code_Blocks

### What might the final design look like?
Our final solution is most likely going to be a glider purchased online **LINK**. We will take the glider and attach a motor onto the glider in order for the glider to fly longer. In order to record the flight data of the motor we will hollow out the cockpit of the glider in order to have room to fit the pico and the sensors. The motor we are using is a small drone motor that we will attach to the top fin of the plane. We are going to replace the foam cockpit cover with a 3D-printed one so we can pop it on and off easily. We will also include an easily accsesible switch so the glider motor is not always running. We will also include a place where you can plug the glider into a computer to access the flight data.

## Launches 

![IMG_2948-ezgif com-video-to-gif-converter](https://github.com/MasonD552/Pi-In-the-Sky/assets/113122312/f8ebccad-ba2f-472b-8973-e9c3bd4d6cf7)

This launch was one of our first and it didn't go great but it was good for a first attempt. The motor did turn on although since we were throwing it with the wind it blew it down. The inside was fine and all the mechanics worked. What we learned is that throwing it with the wind doesn't help flight time and that throwing it higher would be ideal so it doesn't nose dive. Another reason it nose-dived was because the telo battery was too far forward and that weight led it to be front-heavy instead of balanced. 

![IMG_2951-ezgif com-cut](https://github.com/MasonD552/Pi-In-the-Sky/assets/113122312/22587284-9358-4d3c-83fc-9d9515b92a9f)

This second launch was much better than the previous launch above. This time we threw it into the wind and it lifted the plane much more instead of it getting pushed down. The motor turned on and it was in the air for more time than it seems like in the video and when the motor switched off it stopped (which is good to see the motor propelling it). It did fall hard but the inner mechanisms were fine and it was an overall informative test to see how it flies and how long we need to run the motor for.

Take a nice screenshot of your Onshape document. 

### Tweaks 
A design change that we made early on was the propeller guard. It was very flimsy and broke easily, so I put toothpicks up as supports which helped the sturdiness a little. It was still unstable so I ended up printing another part one that would be a full circle and attach to the bottom for stability.

### Reflection

What went wrong / was challenging, how'd you figure it out, and what did you learn from that experience? Your goal for the reflection is to pass on knowledge that will make this assignment better or easier for the next person. Think about your audience for this one, which may be "future you" (when you realize you need some of this code in three months), me, or your college admission committee!

Pt 1. 
![WiringDiagramPiSkypt2](https://github.com/MasonD552/Pi-In-the-Sky/blob/main/images/Untitled%20Sketch%202_bb.png)
Pt 2. We changed the wiring to account for the weight of the pane making it lighter. We removed the MPU 6050. As well as changing the wiring for the Mosfet.
