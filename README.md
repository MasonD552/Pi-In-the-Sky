### Problem 
Designing and constructing the AeroData Tracker, an advanced glider made of styrofoam, equipped with sensors and a motor to maintain speed, presents a multifaceted challenge. The goal extends beyond achieving a successful flight and data capture; it also is demonstrating precise control over the glider's smooth flight.

### Sketches, Drawings, Diagrams, etc.

### Iterations/Solutions
1. Attach a small, lightweight motor to help keep the glider in the air longer
2. Make the glider remote-controlled, adding fins and a more powerful motor.
3. Use a combination of sensors and a recording device for comprehensive data capture.



### What might the final design look like?
Our final solution is most likely going to be a glider purchased online **LINK**. We will take the glider and attach a motor onto the glider in order for the glider to fly longer. In order to record the flight data of the motor we will hollow out the cockpit of the glider in order to have room to fit the pico and the sensors. The motor we are using is a small drone motor that we will attach to the top fin of the plane. We are going to replace the foam cockpit cover with a 3D printed one so we can pop it on and off easily. We will also include an easily accsesible switch so the glider motor is not always running. We will also include a place where you can plug the glider into a computer to access the flight data.

## Onshape

### Description

Write your assignment description here. What is the purpose of this assignment? It should be at least a few sentences.

### Part Images

Take a nice screenshot of your Onshape document. 

### Reflection

What went wrong / was challenging, how'd you figure it out, and what did you learn from that experience? Your goal for the reflection is to pass on knowledge that will make this assignment better or easier for the next person. Think about your audience for this one, which may be "future you" (when you realize you need some of this code in three months), me, or your college admission committee!
